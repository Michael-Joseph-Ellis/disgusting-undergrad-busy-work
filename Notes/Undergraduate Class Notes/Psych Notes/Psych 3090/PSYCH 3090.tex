\chapterclaim{3 Purporses of Statistics}
{
    1. Describe - "Descriptive statistics" (First part of the semester)
    
    2. Make inferences - "Inferential statistics" (Second part of the semester)
    
    3. Communicate effectively - How to describe the data that you've got. (Throughout the semester)
}

\subsubsection{Why is learning stats important?}
\noindent Stages of scientific research: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item State the question
    \item Develop a hypothesis 
    \item Define variables
    \item Observe
    \item Analyze
    \item Make conclusions, refine theory, repeat
\end{itemize}
However, to which of these levels is knowledge of stats relevant?
\textbf{Statistics is relevant at all stages of scientific research.}
\newline\newline
\noindent\underline{Understanding stats\dots}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is crucial when \underline{doing research}. 
    \item Is crucial when \underline{reading} others' research.
    \item Helps you \underline{think critically about data}.
    \item Is marketable! Survival in the information economy\dots
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Big Picture: 4 Key Terms}
\chapterdefinition{The Big Picture: 4 Key Statistical Terms}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Population - The entire group of interest. 
        \item Parameters describe populations. These parameters are often symbolized by greek letters.
        \item Sample - A subset of the population.
        \item Statistics describe samples. These statistics are often symbolized by english letters.
    \end{itemize}
    \textit{Note: An inference is a study from a sample going to the population. i.e., "I have a sample of 100 people, and I want to make a statement about the population of 1000 people."}
}

\subsubsection{3 Kinds of Variables}
\chapterdefinition{3 Kinds of Variables}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dependant Variables - What we measure in an experiment.
        \item Independant Variables - What we manipulate in an experiment.
        \item Extraneous Variables - Any variable that is neither a DV or an IV. 
    \end{itemize}
    \textit{Note: \underline{Memory Tip 1:} "The \underline{dependant} variable \underline{depends} on the independant variable."} \newline
    \textit{Note: \underline{Memory Tip 2:} "The \underline{d}ependant variable is your \underline{d}ata."}
}

\subsubsection{Correlations vs. Experiements} 

\textbf{Correlations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Examine wheather two or more DVs are related.
    \item \textbf{No IVs.}
\end{itemize}
Correlations are typically \underline{seen} in scatterplots; \underline{measured} by "r". 
\newline\newline
\textbf{Correlation does not prove causation!} The problem with correlations is what really causes what?
An example of this is the "vulnerability model" which states that people who have low self-esteem are more likely to be depressed. i.e., A causes B.
Another example is the "scar model" which states that people who are depressed are more likely to have low self-esteem. i.e., B causes A.
Finally, the "third variable" model states that there is an unknown third variable that causes both A and B. i.e., C causes A and B.
\newline\newline
To establish causality, we need three things:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Covariation
    \item Proper Sequence (cause \underline{then} effect)
    \item No confounds (\textit{Def: Any extraneous variable that changes when an IV changes})
\end{itemize}
Let's look at an example experiment. 
\sectionexample{Hot Peppers -> Mortality}
{
DV: Mortality \newline 
IV: Consumption of hot peppers (Y/N) \newline
Extraneous variables: Infinite (most are NP) \newline 
Confounds allowed: \textbf{NONE}
}
\noindent\textbf{Experiments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine if changes in an IV \underline{cause} changes in a DV.
    \item \textbf{Require at least one IV.} 
\end{itemize}

\noindent Before getting into the measurements of a DV, there are two ways to manipulate an IV.

\chapterdefinition{Ways to Manipulate an IV}
{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Between-subjects}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Split sample into separate groups 
        \item Each group gets a different level of the IV 
        \item Comparison is \underline{between} groups
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Within-subjects} (also called "\underline{repeated measures}")
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each member of the sample experiences each level of the IV 
        \item Comparison is \underline{within} the group
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Within-subjects gives \underline{statistical power,} but\dots gives more danger of \underline{learning effects} \newline 
\textit{Ex: testing a new teaching method\dots}
}
\subsubsection{Measuring DVs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Measurement = assigning numbers to objects or events according to rules 
    \item \textit{Examples:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Your jersey number is 5 
        \item You graduated 5$^{th}$ in your class
        \item It is 5$^{\circ}$ fahrenheit outside
        \item The wind is 5 mph
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The following is not very interesting topic, but is crucial to remember, there are four measurement scales (from least sophisticaed to most):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Nominal 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For identification\dots \textit{Ex: CUID number, SSN} 
        \item \dots~or for categorical data 
        \item Good for classifying and counting\dots \textit{Ex: 5\% of CU students are psych majors}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ordinal (put in order; ranking)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Ex: Measuring class rank}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Interval - There are \underline{equal intervals} between values. But there is \underline{no meaningful zero} point. Cannot make any meaningful ratios. Finally, interval variables often found in \underline{surveys}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Ex: The temp diff between 10$^{\circ}$ and 20$^{\circ}$ is the same as diff between 90$^{\circ}$ and 100$^{\circ}$.}
        \item \textit{Ex: 0$^{\circ}$ does not mean there is no heat, so it is not a meaningful zero.}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ratio - Equal intervals \underline{AND} a meaningful zero. Can make valid ratios. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Ex: Number of points you will score on exam one}
        \item \textit{Ex: Distance, time, and money}
        \item \textit{Ex: Temperature measured in $^{\circ}$ Kelvin}
        \item \textit{Ex: 60 seconds is exactly three times as long as 20 seconds}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\underline{Examples from Clinical Psych}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \underline{Disorders:} Mental retardation, autism, separation anxiety (Nominal)
    \item \underline{Mental Retardation Classes:} Mild, moderate, severe, profound (Ordinal)
    \item Define \underline{degree of retardation} using IQ scores (Interval)
\end{itemize}

\noindent Why are these scales important to us? Firstly, some stat. procedures \underline{depend} on the measurement scales. For example, choosing a
textbook provider, i.e., Pearson's v. Spearman's. Secondly, the scales tell us what we can do with our numbers. 
\textit{Earlier examples:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Your jersey number is 5 (Nominal)
    \item You graduated 5$^{th}$ in your class (Ordinal)
    \item It is 5$^{\circ}$ fahrenheit outside (Interval)
    \item The wind is 5 mph (Ratio)
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\sectionexample{Driving Experiment}
{
    \textbf{The \underline{design} of the experiment:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dynamic contrast sensitivity - Ability to see low contrast objects.
        \item IVs 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Alcohol (3 Levels) 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Alcohol (target BAC = 0.10\%)
                \item Control (expecting no alcohol, given none)
                \item Placebo (expecting acohol but given none)
            \end{itemize}
            \item Target motion (2 levels) 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Stationary targets
                \item Moving targets
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Some extraneous variables (To be controlled)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Age 
            \item Drinking history
            \item Medical conditions
            \item Presence of other drugs
            \item Stomach contents 
            \item Many others
        \end{itemize}
        \item \underline{Methods}\dots (stated verbally, unfortunate)
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{The \underline{results} of the experiement.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item But alcohol \underline{severely} reduced the ability to see \underline{moving} targets.
        \item The two measures of intoxication are NOT related\dots i.e., breath alcohol content (\%) and perceived intoxication level.
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{The \underline{conclusion} of the experiment.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Moderate doses of alcohol (IV) severely reduce our ability to see low contrast moving targets (the DV)
    \end{itemize}
}

\section{Frequeny Distributions \& Percentiles}

With continuous data you can build a frequency distribution based on intervals.
\chapterdefinition{Frequency Distribution}{A table showing the number of scores in each category or interval.}
\subsubsection{Building a frequency distribution:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Find the range of scores
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Range = biggest - smallest
    \end{itemize}
    \item Determine \underline{number of intervals} \& \underline{interval width}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Usually 10 - 15 intervals 
        \item Approx. interval width: (range / number of intervals)
    \end{itemize}
    \item List the limits of each interval 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First interval must contain lowest score
    \end{itemize}
    \item Tally the raw scores into intervals
    \item Add up the tallies 
\end{itemize} 

\sectionexample{Exam scores example}
{
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Gather data - \textit{Data: (25 Exam scores)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 82, 75, 88, 93, 53, 84, 87, 58, 72, 94, 69, 84, 61, 91, 64, 87, 84, 70, 76, 89, 75, 80, 73, 78, 60
        \end{itemize}
        \item Find the range and number of intervals needed.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Range = 94 - 53 = 41
            \item Width = 2 
            \item Number of intervals needed to cover 41 = 21 (too many)
            \item How about if we try a width of 10? 
            \item Number of intervals needed to cover 41 = 5 (too few)
            \item Finally, we choose a width of 5. 
            \item Number of intervals needed to cover 41 = 9 (perfect) 
        \end{itemize}
        \item List the intervals and frequency.
        Intervals - 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 50 - 54 
            \item 55 - 59
            \item 60 - 64
            \item 65 - 69
            \item 70 - 74
            \item 75 - 79
            \item 80 - 84
            \item 85 - 89
            \item 90 - 94
        \end{itemize}
        Frequency - 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 5, 5, 4, 3 = 25 (n)
        \end{itemize}
        \% Frequency (divide frequency by total exam scores) -
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 4, 4, 12, 4, 12, 16, 20, 16, 12 = 100
        \end{itemize}
        Cumulative Frequency -
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 13, 18, 22, 25
        \end{itemize}
        Cumulative \% Frequency -
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 4, 8, 20, 24, 36, 52, 72, 88, 100
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[ybar interval, ymax = 5, ymin = 0, minor y tick num = 1]
            \addplot coordinates { (52, 1) (57, 1) (62, 3) (67, 1) (72, 3) (77, 4) (82, 5) (87, 4) (92, 3) };
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
}

\subsubsection{Cumulative Distribution, Percentiles \& Percentile Ranks}
\sectiondefinition{Cumulative Distribution}
{
    A cumulative distribution indicates the percentage of scores that are \underline{less than or equal} to each value.
}
\sectiondefinition{Percentile Rank}
{
    The \underline{percentage} of the distribution that is below a specific score (0\% - 100\%) (y-axis)
    \newline 
    \textit{Ex:} "The percentile rank of a score of 85 is 75\%."
}
\sectiondefinition{Percentile}
{
    This is the score that exceeds a given percentage of the distribution. (x-axis)
    \newline
    \textit{Ex:} "The 40th percentile is an exam score of 75."
}

\subsubsection{Stem-and-leaf Displays}
These are typically excellent for visualizing a distribution. They're used more for 
\textit{exploring data} than for presenting to an audience. 

\section{Describing Data Using Numbers}
\subsubsection{Measures of Center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mode - the most frequent value. Think of a bell curve, where the tip is the mean. Often times a single bell curve is "unimodal". 
    However, they can also be "bimodal".
    \item Median - the score in the middle of the distribution. (the 50th percentile.) 
    To find the location of the median in an ordered array, use the formula : (N + 1)/2. \textit{NOTE: That this is \underline{NOT} how you FIND the median.}
    \item Mean - $\bar{x}$ = $\frac{\sum x}{N}$. The mean is the balance point of the distribution.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Sample mean: $\bar{x}$ = $\frac{\sum x}{n}$ (This is a \underline{statistic}, since it describes a sample.) 
\newline
Population Mean: $\mu$ = $\frac{\sum x}{N}$ (This is a \underline{parameter}, since it describes a population.)

\sectionexample{\underline{Number of sexual partners}}
{
    
    \textbf{\underline{Bottom line:} The mean can be misleading when there are extreme scores. To really understand your data, look at \underline{all three} measures of center.}
}

\subsubsection{Key Features of Means}
% try to use multicol here instead 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\sum(x - \bar{x})$ always = 0
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3
        \item 4
        \item 5
        \item 6
        \item 7
    \end{itemize} 
    The mean of this data set is 5. ($\bar{x}$ = 5)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item -2
        \item -1
        \item 0
        \item 1
        \item 2
    \end{itemize}
    These are the "Deviation scores"; $\sum(x - \bar{x})$ = 0.00

    \item The sum of the squared deviations $\sum(x - \bar{x})^2$ is minimized by the mean.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 3
        \item 4
        \item 5
        \item 6
        \item 7
    \end{itemize}
    The mean is 5.00. ($\bar{x}$ = 5.00)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item -2
        \item -1
        \item 0
        \item 1
        \item 2
    \end{itemize}
    The sum of the deviation score is 0.00. ($\sum(x - \bar{x})$ = 0.00)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 4
        \item 1
        \item 0
        \item 1
        \item 4
    \end{itemize}
    The sum of the squared deviations is 10.00. ($\sum(x - \bar{x})^2$ = 10.00)
    \item Try another value where $\bar{x}$ = 4
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1
        \item 0
        \item 1
        \item 4
        \item 9
    \end{itemize}
    The sum of the squared deviations is 15.00. ($\sum(x - \bar{x})^2$ = 15.00)
\end{itemize}

Only the \underline{mean} keeps the seesaw balanced! That's because $\sum(x - \bar{x})$ = 0.00. 
For skewed distributions, the \underline{median} is most useful.

\section{Measures of Spread}

\subsection{Three Most Common Measures of Spread}
These are going from least to most sophisticated ways of measuring spread.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Range = Largest - Smallest
    \item Variance = $\frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{N}$. \textit{Ex: }
    \begin{multicols}{3}
        The following are X
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 3
            \item 4
            \item 5
            \item 6
            \item 7
        \end{itemize}
        $\bar{x}$ = 5.00

        \columnbreak
        The following are X - $\bar{x}$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item -2
            \item -1
            \item 0
            \item 1
            \item 2
        \end{itemize}
        $\sum(X - \bar{x})$ = 0.00

        \columnbreak
        The following is $(X - \bar{x})^2$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 4
            \item 1
            \item 0
            \item 1
            \item 4
        \end{itemize}
        $\sum(X - \bar{x})^2$ = 10.00 \textit{Note: This is also called sum of the squared deviations, or "sum of squares" or "SS"}
    \end{multicols}
    In the end, the variance is 2.00.
    \item Standard Deviation = $\sqrt{Variance}$. \textit{Ex: } $\sqrt{2.00}$ = 1.41. \textbf{Memorize this for the exam.}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Standard Deviation = $S_x = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{N}}$
\newline
Population Standard Deviation = $\sigma_x = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x - \mu)^2}{N}}$
\newline 
Estimated Population Standard Deviation = $s_x = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$
\newline\newline
The first two are used when \underline{describing} data. The third is used when making \underline{inferences}. All three of these are "center-based" measures of spread. 

\sectionexample{Number Of times Rated}
{
    \begin{multicols}{3}
        The following is X
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 0
            \item 5
            \item 3
            \item 0
            \item 2
            \item 4
            \item 5
            \item 6
        \end{itemize}
        $\sum x$ = 25. $\bar{x}$ = 3.12.

        \columnbreak
        The following is X - $\bar{x}$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item -3.12
            \item 1.87
            \item -.13
            \item -3.12
            \item -1.13
            \item .87
            \item 1.87
            \item 2.87
        \end{itemize}
        $\sum(X - \bar{x})$ = 0.00

        \columnbreak
        The following is $(X - \bar{x})^2$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 9.50
            \item 3.50
            \item .02
            \item 9.80
            \item 1.28
            \item .76
            \item 3.50
            \item 8.24
        \end{itemize}
        $\sum(X - \bar{x})^2$ = 36.88
    \end{multicols}
    Finally, using the standard deviation formula of $S_x = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{N}}$, we get a standard deviation of 2.15

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Mean, median, mode
        \end{itemize}
        \item Spread
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Range, standard deviation, variance
        \end{itemize}
        \item Form 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
We've talked about the first two but what about \underline{form}?

\subsection{Measures of Form}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Modality - The number of peaks in a distribution. \textit{Ex: Unimodal or bimodal.}
    \item Skewness - The degree to which a distribution is asymmmetrical. \textit{Ex: Positively (right \& (mean < median < mode)) or negatively (left \& (mode < median < mean)) skewed.} 
    \item Kurtosis - The degree to which a distrbution is peaked or flat. \textit{Ex: Leptokurtic (peaked) or platykurtic (flat).}
\end{enumerate}
And these are great, however the best way to see the form of a variable is to use a histogram.

\section{Transformations}

\underline{Effect of transformations on the CENTER:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Adding or subtracting a constant from all data points has same effect on center. 
    \item Multiplying or dividing all data points by a constant has same effect on center.
\end{enumerate}
\underline{Effect of transformations on the SPREAD:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Adding or subtracting a constant has NO effect on spread.
    \item Multiplying or dividing by a constant has same effect on measures of spread (\underline{except the variance!})
    \item Multiplying or dividing a constant multiplies or divides the variance by the \underline{square} of the constant.
\end{enumerate}
