\section*{Problem 2}
\textbf{Problem.} Find the coefficient of \(x^7y^5\) in \((2x-3y)^{12}\).

\medskip
\textbf{Solution.}
By the binomial theorem, the \(x^7y^5\) term occurs when the \(x\)-factor is chosen \(7\) times and the \(y\)-factor \(5\) times:
\[
\binom{12}{7}(2x)^7(-3y)^5
= \binom{12}{7}\,2^7(-3)^5\,x^7y^5.
\]
Hence the coefficient is
\(\binom{12}{7}2^7(-3)^5 = \boxed{-24{,}634{,}368}\).
