\section*{Problem 5}
\textbf{Problem.} Give a combinatorial proof of \(k\binom{n}{k}=n\binom{n-1}{k-1}\).

\medskip
\textbf{Proof.}
Count the number of ways to form a committee of \(k\) people from \(n\) and then choose a chair.

\emph{Method 1:} First choose the committee, then the chair.
There are \(\binom{n}{k}\) ways to choose the committee and \(k\) choices for its chair, for a total of
\(k\binom{n}{k}\) outcomes.

\emph{Method 2:} First choose the chair, then the rest of the committee.
There are \(n\) choices for the chair. After choosing the chair, choose the remaining \(k-1\) members from the remaining \(n-1\) people, which can be done in \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\) ways. This gives
\(n\binom{n-1}{k-1}\) outcomes.

Both methods count the same set of outcomes, hence
\[
k\binom{n}{k}=n\binom{n-1}{k-1}.
