\section*{Problem 1}
\textbf{Problem.} How many distinct strings with seven or more characters can be formed from the letters in \texttt{EVERGREEN}?

\medskip
\textbf{Solution.}
The multiset of letters is
\(\{E^4,\,R^2,\,G,\,V,\,N\}\) (total of 9 letters, with multiplicities as shown).
For length \(k\in\{7,8,9\}\) choose nonnegative integers
\((a_E,a_R,a_G,a_V,a_N)\) satisfying
\[
a_E\le 4,\quad a_R\le 2,\quad a_G,a_V,a_N\le 1,\quad
a_E+a_R+a_G+a_V+a_N=k.
\]
For each feasible choice, the number of distinct strings is
\(\frac{k!}{a_E!\,a_R!\,a_G!\,a_V!\,a_N!}\).
Summing over all feasible 5-tuples yields
\[
N_7 = 4515,\qquad
N_8 = 7560,\qquad
N_9 = 7560.
\]
Therefore the total number of strings of length at least \(7\) is
\[
N = N_7+N_8+N_9 = \boxed{19635}.
\]
