\section*{6. The barber paradox}

A village has a barber who shaves \emph{all and only} those who do not shave themselves.
Who shaves the barber?

\paragraph{Answer:} No one can. In fact, such a barber cannot exist.

\paragraph{Proof. \textit{by contradiction}}
Let $b$ be the barber. There are two exhaustive possibilities.

\emph{Case 1:} $b$ shaves himself. Then $b$ is a person who shaves himself, so by the rule
the barber shaves only those who do \emph{not} shave themselves. Hence $b$ must not shave himself.
Contradiction.

\emph{Case 2:} $b$ does not shave himself. Then $b$ is a person who does not shave himself, so
by the rule the barber must shave him. Hence $b$ shaves himself.
Contradiction.

Both cases contradict the rule, so the initial assumption that such a barber exists is false.
