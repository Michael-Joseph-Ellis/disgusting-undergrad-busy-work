Predicates and domains: $F(p)$ “printer $p$ is out of service,” $B(p)$ “printer $p$ is busy,”
$L(j)$ “print job $j$ is lost,” $Q(j)$ “print job $j$ is queued.” Variables $p$ range over printers; $j$ range over print jobs.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*),leftmargin=*]
\item $\exists p\,(F(p)\land B(p)) \to \exists j\,L(j)$ \\
\emph{If there exists a printer that is both out of service and busy, then at least one print job is lost.}

\item $\forall p\,B(p) \to \exists j\,Q(j)$ \\
\emph{If every printer is busy, then at least one print job is queued.}

\item $\exists j\,(Q(j)\land L(j)) \to \exists p\,F(p)$ \\
\emph{If there exists a print job that is both queued and lost, then there exists a printer that is out of service.}

\item $(\forall p\,B(p)\ \land\ \forall j\,Q(j)) \to \exists j\,L(j)$ \\
\emph{If all printers are busy and all print jobs are queued, then at least one print job is lost.}
\end{enumerate}
