\section*{6. Three consecutive around the circle sum to at least 17 (simple average argument)}

\noindent\textbf{Statement.}
Place the integers $1,2,\dots,10$ around a circle in any order. Then some three consecutive
integers on the circle have sum at least $17$.

\begin{proof}
Label the order $x_1,\dots,x_{10}$ (indices mod $10$) and form the ten three-term sums
\[
s_i = x_i+x_{i+1}+x_{i+2}\qquad(i=1,\dots,10).
\]
Each number $1,\dots,10$ appears in exactly three of these $s_i$, so
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{10} s_i = 3\,(1+2+\cdots+10)=3\cdot 55=165,
\]
and the average of $s_1,\dots,s_{10}$ is $165/10=16.5$.

From Problem 5: the average of a list cannot be larger than its maximum
and cannot be smaller than its minimum. Therefore the maximum of
$s_1,\dots,s_{10}$ is at least their average:
\[
\max\{s_1,\dots,s_{10}\}\ \ge\ 16.5.
\]
Since each $s_i$ is an integer, this forces
\[
\max\{s_1,\dots,s_{10}\}\ \ge\ 17.
\]
In other words, at least one block of three consecutive positions has sum at least $17$.

\end{proof}
