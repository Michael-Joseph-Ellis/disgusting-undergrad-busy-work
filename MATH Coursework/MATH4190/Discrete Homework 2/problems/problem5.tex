\section*{5. At least one number is at least the average}

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Lemma (Two numbers cannot both be below their midpoint).}
For any real numbers $x$ and $y$, it is impossible that
\[
x<\frac{x+y}{2}\quad\text{and}\quad y<\frac{x+y}{2}.
\]

\begin{proof}
Assume for contradiction that both strict inequalities hold.

\smallskip
\noindent\emph{Step 1 (add the inequalities).}
Since addition preserves strict inequality (i.e., if $a<b$ and $c<d$ then
$a+c<b+d$), adding the two assumed inequalities gives
\[
x+y\;<\;\frac{x+y}{2}+\frac{x+y}{2}\;=\;x+y.
\]
This is impossible, because no real number is strictly less than itself.

\smallskip
Therefore our assumption is false. Hence at least one of the two inequalities
fails, which means either
\[
x\ge \frac{x+y}{2}\quad\text{or}\quad y\ge \frac{x+y}{2}.
\]
\end{proof}
