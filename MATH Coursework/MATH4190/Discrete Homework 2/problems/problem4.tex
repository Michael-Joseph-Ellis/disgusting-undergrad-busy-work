\section*{4. Prove the following statements}

\begin{theorem}[a]
If you pick three socks from a drawer containing only blue socks and black socks,
then you obtain a matching pair (two blue or two black).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Take the first two socks. There are only two possibilities.

\emph{Case 1.} The first two socks match. Then you already have a pair.

\emph{Case 2.} The first two socks are different (one blue, one black).
The third sock must be either blue or black. Whichever color it is, it matches one
of the first two. So you still end up with a pair.

In both cases, selecting three socks guarantees a matching pair.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[b]
Among any $64$ calendar days, at least $10$ of them fall on the same weekday.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
There are $7$ weekdays. Try to spread the $64$ days out as evenly as possible
so that no weekday reaches $10$. The best you can do is put at most $9$ days
on each weekday. That uses $9+9+\cdots+9=7\cdot 9=63$ days.

But you still have one more day to place. Wherever you put that last one, some
weekday will now have $10$ days. Therefore, among any $64$ days, at least one
weekday occurs $10$ times.
\end{proof}
