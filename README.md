# Disgusting Undergrad Busy Work

a collection of all the computer science coursework and assignments that I actually remembered to commit to version control during my undergraduate studies.

## What's This?

this repository is essentially a digital graveyard of comp sci busy work from various courses. it's a mess of labs, assignments, projects, and homework that i've been forced to do over the years. most of it is probably terrible code i wrote or gpt wrote for me.

## Course Coverage

this collection spans multiple computer science courses:

- **CPSC 2120** - Data Structures and Algorithms
- **CPSC 2150** - Software Development Foundations  
- **CPSC 2310** - Computer Organization
- **CPSC 3520** - Database Systems
- **CPSC 3600** - Network Programming
- **CPSC 3720** - Software Engineering
- **CPSC 4300** - Applied Data Science

however some courses are nice üòÅ
- **MATH 4190** - Discrete Mathematics

the code in this repo is primarily for archival purposes.
